    "body": "## Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\n* add self-upgrader (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/3501) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5035) this allows to upgrade MediaMTX to latest version by running ./mediamtx --upgrade\r\n* on Windows, do not look for configuration in linux paths (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5036)\r\n* do not include recorder and HLS muxer in sent bytes (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4380)  (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5039) in API (/paths/list, /paths/get) and metrics (paths_bytes_sent), the amount of sent bytes was increased even in case of writes to the recorder and HLS muxer, which are not generating network traffic. This fixes the issue.\r\n* add read and write timeouts in HTTP servers (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5056) this prevents zombie connections from piling up.\r\n* estimate absolute timestamp more precisely (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5078) When the absolute timestamp of incoming frames was not available, it was filled with the current timestamp, which is influenced by latency over time. This mechanism is replaced by an algorithm that detects when latency is the lowest, stores the current timestamp and uses it as reference throughout the rest of the stream.\r\n* prevent estimated absolute timestamp from drifting too much (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5080)\r\n* recorder: reset fMP4 sequence number during segment switch (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5082) It's useless to make sequence numbers unique across the entire stream.\r\n* replace incoming absolute timestamps of any source (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5081) Absolute timestamps are used to generate recording segments, so users should not be able to change them, unless explicitly allowed. Parameter useAbsoluteTimestamp allowed to re-enable absolute timestamps with RTSP and WebRTC, now it is extended to all protocols.\r\n* recorder: write additional infos inside segments (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5083) write stream ID, segment number, DTS, NTP in a dedicated box. This allows to improve the merge algorithm in the playback server.\r\n* playback: improve segment merging algorithm (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5084) * merge segments only if they belong to the same stream and are consecutive. * compute DTS without using NTP timestamp, increasing robustness against NTP fluctuations.\r\n\r\nAPI\r\n\r\n* add /info endpoint (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/945) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5045)\r\n\r\nRTSP\r\n\r\n* Fix: invalid SDP: sdp: invalid syntax `c=IN ` (https://github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/issues/906)\r\n* server: add idle timeout (https://github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/issues/912) this prevents idle connections and sessions from stacking up.\r\n\r\nHLS\r\n\r\n* improve web page performance (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5062) load hls.js in parallel with the page.\r\n\r\nWebRTC\r\n\r\n* fix clippy audio when reading Opus (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/3878) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5047) Opus timestamp is now recomputed from scratch.\r\n* fix packet corruption when reading G711 (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5048) when a reader is reading a G711 track, stream units are modified globally, affecting every other reader. This fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n\r\n* code.cloudfoundry.org/bytefmt updated from v0.52.0 to v0.54.0\r\n* github.com/MicahParks/keyfunc/v3 updated from v3.6.2 to v3.7.0\r\n* github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/v5 updated from v5.0.1 to v5.1.0\r\n* github.com/bluenviron/mediacommon/v2 updated from v2.4.3 to v2.5.0\r\n* github.com/go-git/go-git/v5 updated from v5.16.2 to v5.16.3\r\n* github.com/matthewhartstonge/argon2 updated from v1.4.0 to v1.4.1\r\n* github.com/pion/interceptor updated from v0.1.40 to v0.1.41\r\n* github.com/pion/rtp updated from v1.8.22 to v1.8.23\r\n* golang.org/x/crypto updated from v0.42.0 to v0.43.0\r\n* golang.org/x/sys updated from v0.36.0 to v0.37.0\r\n* golang.org/x/term updated from v0.35.0 to v0.36.0\r\n* github.com/pion/srtp/v3 updated from v3.0.7 to v3.0.8\r\n* github.com/quic-go/quic-go updated from v0.54.0 to v0.54.1\r\n* golang.org/x/net updated from v0.44.0 to v0.46.0\r\n* golang.org/x/text updated from v0.29.0 to v0.30.0\r\n* github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3 v3.4.0 added\r\n* github.com/minio/selfupdate v0.6.0 added\r\n* aead.dev/minisign v0.2.0 added\r\n\r\n## Security\r\n\r\nBinaries are compiled from source through the [Release workflow](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/actions/workflows/release.yml) without human intervention, preventing any external interference.\r\n\r\nYou can verify that binaries have been produced by the workflow by using [GitHub Attestations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/artifact-attestations):\r\n\r\n```\r\nls mediamtx_* | xargs -L1 gh attestation verify --repo bluenviron/mediamtx\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can verify checksums of binaries by downloading `checksums.sha256` and running:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncat checksums.sha256 | grep \"$(ls mediamtx_*)\" | sha256sum --check\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "## Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\n* fix authentication failure reason not being displayed (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5007)\r\n* fix reading JWT when it is passed through the password field (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5009) Usernames and passwords must be requested explicitly to clients, but they were not requested when JWT is meant to be passed as password. This fixes the issue.\r\n* stop accepting JWTs from query parameters unless allowed in conf (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5010) This is the first step into removing support for JWTs in query parameters, which is a security flaw.\r\n* docs: explain how to decrease JWT length in Keycloak (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5012) this prevents errors when passing JWT with FFmpeg and GStreamer.\r\n* log authentication errors of API, metrics, pprof (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4641) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5015)\r\n* allow changing record parameters without disconnecting readers (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4663) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5018)\r\n\r\nAPI\r\n\r\n* fix crash in rtspsessions/list and /rtspsessions/get (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5030) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5031) sometimes sessions have an empty associated path, and this caused a crash.\r\n\r\nRTSP\r\n\r\n* log authentication failure reason (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4641) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5017)\r\n* sdp: fix compatibility with a Uniview camera (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/5008) (https://github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/issues/903)\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n\r\n* code.cloudfoundry.org/bytefmt updated from v0.51.0 to v0.52.0\r\n* github.com/MicahParks/jwkset updated from v0.10.0 to v0.11.0\r\n* github.com/MicahParks/keyfunc/v3 updated from v3.6.1 to v3.6.2\r\n* github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/v5 updated from v5.0.0 to v5.0.1\r\n* github.com/gin-gonic/gin updated from v1.10.1 to v1.11.0\r\n* github.com/bytedance/sonic updated from v1.13.2 to v1.14.0\r\n* github.com/bytedance/sonic/loader updated from v0.2.4 to v0.3.0\r\n* github.com/cloudwego/base64x updated from v0.1.5 to v0.1.6\r\n* github.com/gin-contrib/sse updated from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0\r\n* github.com/go-playground/validator/v10 updated from v10.26.0 to v10.27.0\r\n* github.com/klauspost/cpuid/v2 updated from v2.2.10 to v2.3.0\r\n* github.com/pelletier/go-toml/v2 updated from v2.2.3 to v2.2.4\r\n* github.com/ugorji/go/codec updated from v1.2.12 to v1.3.0\r\n* golang.org/x/arch updated from v0.16.0 to v0.20.0\r\n* google.golang.org/protobuf updated from v1.36.6 to v1.36.9\r\n* github.com/goccy/go-yaml v1.18.0 added\r\n* github.com/quic-go/qpack v0.5.1 added\r\n* github.com/quic-go/quic-go v0.54.0 added\r\n* go.uber.org/mock v0.5.0 added\r\n* golang.org/x/mod v0.28.0 added\r\n* golang.org/x/sync v0.17.0 added\r\n* golang.org/x/tools v0.37.0 added\r\n* hls.js updated from v1.6.12 to v1.6.13\r\n\r\n## Security\r\n\r\nBinaries are compiled from source through the [Release workflow](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/actions/workflows/release.yml) without human intervention, preventing any external interference.\r\n\r\nYou can verify that binaries have been produced by the workflow by using [GitHub Attestations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds):\r\n\r\n```\r\nls mediamtx_* | xargs -L1 gh attestation verify --repo bluenviron/mediamtx\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can verify the binaries checksum by downloading `checksums.sha256` and running:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncat checksums.sha256 | grep \"$(ls mediamtx_*)\" | sha256sum --check\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "## New major features\r\n\r\nRTSP\r\n\r\n* support encrypting UDP and UDP-multicast streams (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4690)\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\n* support routing KLV metadata (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/2693) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4670)\r\n\r\n## Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\n* recorder, playback: support changing codec parameters without switching segment (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4262) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4582)\r\n* record: support storing timezone in recording segments (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/3566) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4597)\r\n* support assigning paths to different configurations without closing stream (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4576)\r\n* add attestation system to protect binaries (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4012) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4629) this allows to prove that binaries were produced by GitHub Actions.\r\n* fix crash when ConfWatcher fails to initialize (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4689)\r\n\r\nRTSP\r\n\r\n* support encrypted streams with SRTP and MIKEY (https://github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/issues/520) (https://github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/issues/809)\r\n* make RTP packet size compatible with RTSP/SRTP (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4692) when RTSP encryption is enabled, maximum RTP packet size is slightly decreased to make room for SRTP.\r\n* client: fix reading sources without server ports (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4253) (https://github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/issues/796) RTCP packets were sent out to nil addresses, due to the lack of server ports, causing an error.\r\n* client: prevent downgrading from RTSPS to RTSP during redirect (https://github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/issues/816)\r\n* client: when reading multicast streams, write unicast reports (https://github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/issues/817) Previously, receiver reports were broadcasted to all connected clients. Now they are sent to the server only.\r\n* client: when reading UDP streams, write reports to right IP (https://github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/issues/818) source IPs sent by the server were not taken into consideration. This fixes the issue.\r\n* set SSRC of outgoing packets (https://github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/issues/803) In client and server, each format now has a fixed, unique, known in advance SSRC, that is applied to outgoing packets belonging to each format. This is needed to support SRTP/MIKEY, that require each format to have a fixed, unique, and known in advance SSRC.\r\n* client: open firewall before sending PLAY request (https://github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/issues/821) this prevents losing some initial packets.\r\n* support KLV tracks (https://github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/issues/808)\r\n\r\nRTMP\r\n\r\n* fix timeout when publishing with GLive T80 (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4002) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4583)\r\n\r\nHLS\r\n\r\n* muxer: fix race condition when closing (https://github.com/bluenviron/gohlslib/issues/236)\r\n* client: fix race condition with non-low-latency streams (https://github.com/bluenviron/gohlslib/issues/237)\r\n* Support Verkada EXTINF Tags (https://github.com/bluenviron/gohlslib/issues/244)\r\n\r\nWebRTC\r\n\r\n* fix writing tracks to some clients (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4602) some clients require PayloadType to be unique among all tracks, not only among tracks of same kind.\r\n\r\nRPI Camera\r\n\r\n* fix RTP packet size (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4691) UDP max payload size was not applied.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n\r\n* code.cloudfoundry.org/bytefmt updated from v0.40.0 to v0.43.0\r\n* github.com/MicahParks/keyfunc/v3 updated from v3.3.11 to v3.4.0\r\n* github.com/alecthomas/kong updated from v1.11.0 to v1.12.0\r\n* github.com/bluenviron/gohlslib/v2 updated from v2.1.5 to v2.2.1\r\n* github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/v4 updated from v4.14.1 to v4.15.0\r\n* github.com/bluenviron/mediacommon/v2 updated from v2.2.0 to v2.3.0\r\n* github.com/go-git/go-git/v5 updated from v5.16.0 to v5.16.2\r\n* github.com/matthewhartstonge/argon2 updated from v1.3.1 to v1.3.2\r\n* github.com/pion/interceptor updated from v0.1.38 to v0.1.40\r\n* github.com/pion/logging updated from v0.2.3 to v0.2.4\r\n* github.com/pion/rtp updated from v1.8.16 to v1.8.20\r\n* github.com/pion/sdp/v3 updated from v3.0.13 to v3.0.14\r\n* golang.org/x/crypto updated from v0.38.0 to v0.39.0\r\n* github.com/pion/srtp/v3 updated from v3.0.4 to v3.0.6\r\n* golang.org/x/net updated from v0.40.0 to v0.41.0\r\n* golang.org/x/text updated from v0.25.0 to v0.26.0\r\n* github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx-rpicamera updated from v2.4.2 to v2.4.3\r\n* hls.js updated from v1.6.2 to v1.6.6\r\n\r\n## Security\r\n\r\nBinaries have been produced by the [Release workflow](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/actions/workflows/release.yml) without human intervention.\r\n\r\nYou can verify that binaries have been produced by the workflow by using [GitHub Attestations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds):\r\n\r\n```\r\nls mediamtx_* | xargs -L1 gh attestation verify --repo bluenviron/mediamtx\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can verify the binaries checksum by downloading `checksums.sha256` and running:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncat checksums.sha256 | grep \"$(ls mediamtx_*)\" | sha256sum --check\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "## Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\n* Feat: Add JWKS rotation API endpoint (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4463)\r\n* add authJWTJWKSFingerprint (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4409) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4514)\r\n* do not ask for credentials when authentication method is JWT (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4450) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4513)\r\n* support passing JWTs through the password field (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4516). This is safer than passing JWTs through query parameters, unfortunately support is limited.\r\n* parse HTTP username and password OR token, not both (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4517)\r\n* allow disabling JWT in HTTP query parameters (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4518)\r\n* allow using colon in path names (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4377) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4519)\r\n* change recommended OBS settings (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4523)\r\n* playback: fix error 404 when seeking before start of segment (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4276) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4533) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4539)\r\n* playback: fix jerky video (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4555). this happened when recording has B-frames, playback format is fmp4 and starting position doesn't correspond to a IDR frame.\r\n* record: fix loss of audio samples during segment switch (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4556)\r\n* Fix: gracefully handle fMP4 segments with missing or partial moof/mdat (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4538)\r\n* recorder: fix duration of first part of a segment (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4562) \r\n* recorder: fix segment duration when audio is in advance (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4563)\r\n* recorder: improve fMP4 splitting algorithm (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4566)\r\n* delete paths that belong to a new configuration (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4013) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4568)\r\n* av1: strip size when decoding bitstreams (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediacommon/issues/197)\r\n\r\nRTSP\r\n\r\n* fix authentication regression (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4557) since https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4267 it was impossible to perform authentication when protocol is RTSP and credentials are hashed.\r\n* fix invalid TID=0 in writeAggregationUnit of rtph265 encoder (https://github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/issues/782)\r\n\r\nRTMP\r\n\r\n* fix connect command when reading (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4512) when reading, the \"connect\" command should not contain fpad,capabilities, audioCodecs, videoCodecs, videoFunction.\r\n* support connecting to sources that require standard credentials (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4530)\r\n\r\nHLS\r\n\r\n* fix toggling hlsAlwaysRemux after server is started (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4503)\r\n* muxer: return error when timestamp is impossible to handle (https://github.com/bluenviron/gohlslib/issues/233)\r\n* muxer: remove useless computation in MPEG-TS variant (https://github.com/bluenviron/gohlslib/issues/234)\r\n\r\nWebRTC\r\n\r\n* prevent routine leaks (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4558) wait for all routines to exit before assuming a WebRTC connection is closed.\r\n* fix race condition after https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4558 (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4564)\r\n\r\nSRT\r\n\r\n* set source not ready when reader exits (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4467)\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n\r\n* Go

Switch from 'no one is publishing to path' to 'no stream is available. on path' since the stream might be provided from a static source too.\r\n* record: prevent recordDeleteAfter from deleting current segment (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4331)\r\n* allow to customize syslog prefix (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4356). Co-authored-by: Кадышев Вячеслав <v.kadyshev@dssl.ru>\r\n* count and log all discarded frames, decode errors, lost packets (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4363). Discarded frames, decode errors and lost packets were logged individually, then there was a mechanism that prevented more than 1 log entry per second from being printed, resulting in inaccurate reports. Now discarded frames, decode errors and lost packets are accurately counted, and their count is printed once every second.\r\n* prevent unmarshalers from returning empty byte arrays (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediacommon/issues/186)\r\n\r\nAPI\r\n\r\n* fix crash in /recordings/list (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4040) (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/4291). The API crashed when: * '%path%' is not present in 'recordPath' * 'all_others' is in 'paths' * there's at least one recording segment. A recording segment without path is parsed as a segment with an empty path. This path is then passed to FindPathConf(), that returns an error in case of empty or invalid paths. This error is not checked for performance reasons, leading to the crash.

This improves performance, security and removes a dependency.\r\n\r\nHLS\r\n\r\n* in logs, store both ip and port of incoming requests (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/3013)\r\n* when alwaysRemux is true, prevent clients from creating muxers (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/3015)\r\n* fix crash when muxer is being recreated, improve performance (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/3017)\r\n* stop spamming 'stream doesn't contain any supported codec' when hlsAlwaysRemux is true (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/3018)\r\n* client: fix race condition when decoding time of MPEG-TS streams (https://github.com/bluenviron/gohlslib/issues/141)\r\n* client: fix race condition when reading absolute time (https://github.com/bluenviron/gohlslib/issues/142)\r\n\r\nWebRTC\r\n\r\n* return an error when proxying stream with no tracks (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/3042)\r\n\r\nSRT\r\n\r\n* add additional metrics (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/2962) by @nerdbaggy\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n\r\n* build(deps): bump golang.org/x/crypto from 0.18.0 to 0.19.0 (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/3002)\r\n* bump hls-js to v1.5.4 (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/2999). Co-authored-by: mediamtx-bot <bot@mediamtx>\r\n* bump hls-js to vv1.5.5 (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/3019). Co-authored-by: mediamtx-bot <bot@mediamtx>\r\n* build(deps): bump github.com/bluenviron/mediacommon from 1.9.1 to 1.9.2 (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/3030)\r\n* bump hls.js to v1.5.6 (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/3038). Co-authored-by: mediamtx-bot <bot@mediamtx>\r\n* bump hls.js to v1.5.7 (https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/issues/3072).
